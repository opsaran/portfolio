      <p>
        Every day I wake up at 3AM to solve some of the coding problems caused
        by my memory.
        <br />
        I'm an IIT KGP dropout who became a salesman and now in love with web
        development. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Look..., I didn't grow up with computer around me but damn!
        now I love coding.
        <br />
        I'm passionate about Startups in general and that's where I can add the
        most value given my complex background of event-management, operations
        and sales.
        <br />
        <br />
        Looking forward to build some great products.
