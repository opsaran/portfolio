      <h1>About me</h1>

      <p>
        I'm a self-taught full stack web developer, currently working as a
        freelancer.
        <br />
        <br />
        I dropped out of IIT Kgp to find a passion and kind of work that I
        enjoy.
        <br />
        <br />I pick a skill I want to be good at and research about it. I
        practice untill I feel comfortable doing that and that's how I learn new
        technologies quickly.
        <br />
        I have keen interest in both frontend and backend technologies.
        <br />
        I'm passionate about Startups in general and that's where I can add the
        most value given my complex background of event-management, operations
        and sales.
        <br />
        <br />
        Looking forward to build some great products that users admire.
