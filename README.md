# Personal portfolio

Goal of this project was to showcase my design skills while using CSS3 and reactJs. I didn't want to use any CSS or react library and I have made a decent website. 

## Progression

Plan is to style more and more elements to make it look cooler. 

### Database integretion

I wanted to test basic react skills and created a review section. I haven't linked it to an external database yet. I want to learn a lot about backend.
