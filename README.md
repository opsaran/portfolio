# Personal portfolio

This is my portfolio website V2.0. I have used React with CSS to build this website.
I have used formspree to recieve feedback on my portfolio and all other projects, so please don't forget to leave a message there.

## Deployment

The site is deployed on netlify using Github for continuous deployment.

## Progression

This is not the end, I want to keep improving how it looks and how it performs.
